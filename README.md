# Google fonts clone - Chingu Voyage 13 pre-work project
This is a the README file for clone Google font clone repo, which is the solo projoct of Chingu tier 1. I used for this app, vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## Use resources:
Font awesome

Google fonts


## Functionality
 1. One can search for a font and filter through the list by typing the font name (search fonts)
 2. Text typed into the custom text (type something) box will immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
 3. The sample text will return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input.
 4. Font size chooser has some option sizes and will immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
 5. Clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the menu bar; will make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page.


 *Work in progress*

 1. We can change the home page background color to either “Black” or  “White” by clicking on the two round buttons stick to each other. We can notice one button is black and the other one is white.
2. We can also decide to change the view to a list mode by clicking on the list icon
