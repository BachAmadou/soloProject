# soloProject

<!-- This projet is about cloning google font home page. It is done with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

THE USE FOR THE APP:

1. One can search for a font and filter through the list by typing the font name (First search bar)
2. One can type some text (any type of text) in the search bar and when typing your text, it will at the same time show in the cards (second search bar)
3. One can change the font size of the text. Use the select options to update the text size as you fit.
4. We can change the home page background color to either “Black” or  “White” by clicking on the two round buttons stick to each other. We can notice one button is black and the other one is white.
5. We can also decide to change the view to a list mode by clicking on the list icon
6. At last, we can reset the text inside the cards by clicking on the reset button

REQUIREMENTS:

Structure

 1. Header with minor navigation (Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)
 2. Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation (search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)
 3. Main section to contain the font cards
 4. Font cards which display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text, and an add button
 5. Footer section with your developer information
Style

 1. Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
 2. Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)
 3. Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable
Functionality

 1. Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
 2. The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
 3. Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
 4. Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (do not actually reload the page) -->
